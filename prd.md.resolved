# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Developer Project Showcase

## 1. Problem Statement
Developers often find mainstream social networks too noisy and unfocused. There is a lack of dedicated spaces where they can:
- Showcase their side projects and work-in-progress without getting lost in the noise.
- Receive constructive, technical feedback.
- Find collaborators for their specific tech stack.
- Filter out non-developer content (politics, memes, etc.).

## 2. Solution: "Project Twist" (Working Title)
A niche social platform strictly for developers to showcase projects, get feedback, and collaborate. The platform focuses on "shipping" and "collaborating" rather than "engagement farming."

## 3. Core Value Proposition
- **Signal over Noise**: Curated specifically for development projects.
- **Collaboration First**: Features built to help people find contributors.
- **Weekly Highlights**: Automated summarization of the best projects to ensure visibility.

## 4. User Personas
1.  **The Builder**: Has a side project, wants feedback and maybe a co-founder/contributor.
2.  **The Learner/Contributor**: Wants to contribute to open source or real projects to learn or build a portfolio.
3.  **The Observer**: Enjoys seeing what others are building and staying updated on trends.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Project Showcase (The "Feed")
- Users can post projects.
- Required fields: Title, Description, GitHub Link, Live Demo Link (optional), Tech Stack (Tags).
- Embed support for rich media (images, videos) to show off the UI/functionality.

### 5.2 Collaboration Engine
- "Open for Collaboration" toggle on projects.
- "Help Wanted" tags (e.g., "Need UI Designer", "Need Rust Expert").
- Easy "Apply" or "Message" button for potential contributors.

### 5.3 Automated Weekly Highlights
- System identifies trending or high-potential projects weekly.
- Generates a "Weekly Digest" newsletter/page.
- Criteria: Activity (commits), community engagement (likes/comments), and manual curation (admin picks).

### 5.4 Social Features
- Follow users/projects.
- Comments (Markdown supported for code snippets).
- Upvote/Star projects.

### 5.5 User Profiles
- GitHub integration (import pinned repos?).
- Tech stack badges.
- "Projects I'm Working On" section.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast load times, crucial for a dev audience.
- **Aesthetics**: Dark mode default, clean code snippets, "Geek" aesthetic (monospaced fonts, terminal vibes optionally).
- **Mobile Responsive**: Must work well on mobile for reading/keeping up.

## 7. Future Scope (Post-MVP)
- Integration with Product Hunt (auto-post?).
- Hackathon hosting.
- Monetization (Job board, Sponsored tools).
